# Firewall Config

This is some of my linux iptables configuration.
I am going to add to this repository over time. 

## Note

This script is witten for CentOS. 
IF you want to run it for other distros you should install ipset and enable the ipset service.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository then cd to the firewall-config directory and set the execution permission with this command.

```
chmod +x firewall_config.sh
```

Then run the script and you are done.

```
sudo firewall_config.sh
```
