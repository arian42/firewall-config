# Firewall Config

This is some of my linux iptables config and I am going to add to this repository over time. 

## Getting Started

This is for CentOS only. Clone this repository then go to the directory and set permission

```
chmod +x ./firewall_config.sh
```

then run the script

```
sudo ./firewall_config.sh
```
